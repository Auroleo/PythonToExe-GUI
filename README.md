# PythonToExe-GUI
An easy GUI that build exe file from .py.  
一个带有交互界面的pyinstaller库操作程序。

## How to use it 使用说明
Directly click 'GUIface.py' to run.  
直接双击“GUIface”即可运行。

## How it was made 制作说明
This is a program which is created from an idea that I've packaged a lot of python files to executable files. It's not easy to use CMD to package the file, so I designed a GUI face to show it to run.

It's depend on the PYINSTALLER module. Don't worry, it'll run even though you've not installed this module.

这是一个在我打包.py到.exe文件时的想法（突发奇想？）；这个程序可以直观的展示打包的过程，再也不用学习指令了（笑）。

它依赖PYINSTALLER库。直接运行就完事了，打包时会自动地安装库的！
